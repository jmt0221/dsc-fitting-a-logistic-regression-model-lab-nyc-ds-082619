    "# Fitting a Logistic Regression Model - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "You were previously given a broad overview of logistic regression. This included two separate packages for creating logistic regression models. In this lab, you'll be investigating fitting logistic regressions with statsmodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Implement logistic regression with statsmodels\n",
    "* Interpret the statistical results associated with regression model parameters\n"

    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "The statsmodels example we covered had four essential parts:\n",
    "* Importing the data\n",
    "* Defining X and y\n",
    "* Fitting the model\n",
    "* Analyzing model results\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding code to these four steps was:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 1: Importing the data\n",
    "salaries = pd.read_csv(\"salaries_final.csv\", index_col = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 2: Defining X and y\n",
    "x_feats = [\"Race\", \"Sex\", \"Age\"]\n",
    "X = pd.get_dummies(salaries[x_feats], drop_first=True, dtype=float)\n",
    "y = pd.get_dummies(salaries[\"Target\"], dtype=float)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 3: Fitting the model\n",
    "X = sm.add_constant(X)\n",
    "logit_model = sm.Logit(y.iloc[:,1], X)\n",
    "result = logit_model.fit()\n",
    "\n",
    "#Step 4: Analyzing model results\n",
    "result.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this should be fairly familiar to you; importing data with Pandas, initializing a regression object, and calling the fit method of that object. However, step 2 warrants a slightly more in depth explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we fit the salary data using `Race`, `Sex`, and `Age`. Since `Race` and `Sex` are categorical, we converted them to dummy variables using the `get_dummies()` method. The ```get_dummies()``` method will only convert `object` and `category` data types to dummy variables so it is safe to pass `Age`. Note that we also passed two additional arguments, ```drop_first=True``` and ```dtype=float```. The ```drop_first=True``` argument removes the first level for each categorical variable and the ```dtype=float``` argument converts the data type of all of the dummy variables to float. The data must be float in order to obtain accurate statistical results from statsmodel. Finally, note that y itself returns a pandas DataFrame with two columns as y itself was originally a categorical variable. With that, it's time to try and define a logistic regression model on your own!"
